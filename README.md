# tic-tac-toe
For this project, I decided to code my own version of the game tic-tac-toe using Python. 

Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game, that is played on a 3Ã—3 square grid. Each player occupies a cell in turns, with the objective of placing three marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal pattern. One player uses cross 'X' as his marker, while the other uses a naught 'O'.

The game is playable in the command line and you can choose to play against the computer or with a friend, where one person is "X" and the other plays "O".
